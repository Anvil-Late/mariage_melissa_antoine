      <description>This project&amp;rsquo;s goal is to build a model that can classify consumer goods based on pictures and descriptions.
I approached this project with basic and advanced methods for both NLP and image recognition.
For basic methods, I used feature extractions and clustering, whereas for advanced methods I used supervised neural networks.
Moreover, the dataset we were provided with was small, which made it necessary to either use dimension reduction for clustering algorithms or transfer learning for neural networks.</description>
